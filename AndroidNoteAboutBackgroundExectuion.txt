***** Service Limitations ******* 
=> Service class will no longer work in oreo version.startService() will throw exception while your app is in background or idle.
=> it is always legal to call startForegroundService() instead of startService.
=> We should also 

*** JobService ****

=> JobService is replacement for Service class since lollipop

=> JobService will execute work on specific condition not on specific time interval

=> Min TimeInterval for JobService is 15 Min sincce api 25

	now the question is How to Shedule job every 30 seconds or arount it
	what is startJob and stopJob boolen parameter

=> so If we want to shedule job on regular interval JobService is not right choise

*** FusedLcoation Api

=> Background Location Limits : - In an effort to reduce power consumption, Android 8.0 (API level 26) limits how frequently background apps    can    retrieve the user's current location. Apps can receive location updates only a few times each hour
=> By using the batched version of FLP, however, you have access to more time-frequent location history after your app receives a batch update, which    also occurs only a few times each hour.

*** The system distinguishes between foreground and background apps when 

	It has a visible activity, whether the activity is started or paused.
	It has a foreground service.
	Another foreground app is connected to the app, either by binding to one of its services or by making use of one of its content providers. For 	example, if a foreground app binds to any of the following components within another app, that other app is considered to be in the 		foreground:
	Input method editor (IME)
	Wallpaper service
	Notification listener
	Voice or text service
	
	If none of those conditions is true, the app is considered to be in the background.

*** Geofencing

	Background apps can receive geofencing transition events more frequently than updates from the Fused Location Provider.
	The average responsiveness for a geofencing event is every couple of minutes or so.

**** Broadcast receiver limitations

=> statically defined broadcast receiver will no longer receive those broadcasts.
=> apps that target the API level 26 or higher can no longer register broadcast receivers for implicit broadcasts in their manifest
=> Apps can continue to register listeners for the following broadcasts, no matter what API level the apps target.
	ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED, ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED
	ACTION_USER_INITIALIZEACTION_LOCALE_CHANGED
	ACTION_LOCALE_CHANGED
	ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED

	SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION, WAP_PUSH_RECEIVED_ACTION
=> to work with receiver in oreo it has to be explicit receiver.
=> Ex. Context.registerReciever() will work bcoze you have to unRegister() it on Destroy.
